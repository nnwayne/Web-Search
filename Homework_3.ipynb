    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day\n",

    "<b>Marks</b>: 7% of mark for class (with 6% on correctness + 1% on quality and efficiency of your code)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "To familiarize yourself with NLTK, here is a free online book:  Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009). <a href=http://nltk.org/book>Natural Language Processing with Python</a>. O'Reilly Media Inc. You may also consult the <a href=https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html>NLTK API</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

Different length words tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes.

You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the (unlikely) situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training.

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, using a *bigram* language model over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should develop a *bigram* language model over characters, train this over the training words (being careful to handle the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a sentinel symbol `$`.) You should use *linear interpolation* to smooth between the higher order and lower order models, and you will have to decide how to weight each component (be reminded that all probabilities should sum to 1).\n",

    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using the left context as is known. E.g., in the partial word `$ _ e c _ e _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. Using a bigram language model, we are able to apply it to the first three blanks only. You should then select the character with the highest probability of predicting the most number of correct entries over the blanks. \n",
